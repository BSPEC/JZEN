# Purpose
Unleash the power of JSON to supercharge your coding experience! Imagine a world where your models and applications seamlessly communicate across diverse programming languages. With JSON, that's not just possible—it's easy! Elevate your interoperability game to the next level and build consistently brilliant projects, regardless of the language. Get ready to redefine what you thought was possible with JSON! ☯︎

##  The key aspects of any programming language can vary depending on the language's design goals, but generally, most programming languages have the following key components:

### Data Types
- **Primitive Types**: Basic types like integers, floating-point numbers, and booleans.
- **Composite Types**: Types that can hold multiple values, like arrays and objects.
- **Custom Class/Type**: Types that are defined by a user such as a class. e.g. `Addresses`
  
### Variables and Constants
- **Variables**: Storage locations that can hold different values.
- **Constants**: Storage locations whose value cannot be changed once set.
- **Variable assignment**: Assign Values to variables or constants.

### Control Structures
- **Conditional Statements**: `if`, `else`, `switch`, etc., for decision-making.
- **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`, etc., for repetition.
  
### Functions and Procedures
- **Built-in Functions**: Functions provided by the language for common tasks.
- **User-defined Functions**: Functions that the programmer defines.

### Input and Output
- **Standard I/O**: Reading from and writing to the console, files, etc.
- **GUI I/O**: Interaction via graphical elements like buttons and text boxes.

### Error Handling
- **Exceptions**: Mechanisms for catching and handling errors.
- **Debugging Tools**: Tools for identifying and fixing errors in code.

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **Standard Library**: A set of pre-compiled functions and procedures.
- **Third-party Libraries**: Libraries developed by other programmers to extend functionality.

### Memory Management
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic reclaiming of unused memory.
- **Manual Memory Management**: Functions for allocating and freeing memory.

### Concurrency
- **Threads**: Multiple lines of execution within the same program.
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous programming constructs.

### Classes and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Class Definition**: A blueprint for creating objects (instances).
- **Inheritance**: The mechanism by which one class can inherit attributes and methods from another class.
- **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or object.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different objects to be treated as objects of a common superclass.
- **Constructors and Destructors**: Special methods for initializing and cleaning up objects.
- **Access Modifiers**: Keywords that determine the visibility of class members (public, private, protected).
- **Static Members**: Attributes and methods that belong to the class rather than any particular object instance.
- **Interfaces and Abstract Classes**: Define a contract that classes must adhere to, without providing an implementation.

### Instances of Classes
- **instance Variables**: 
- **Parameters Passed in**: Which parameters are passed in

### Order of events
- **Loading**: what is required to be availible in order to allow things to run. what modules, classes etc need to be availible to run
- **Entry and exit points**: Where do things start, terminate and what order do events happen in?

### Modularity and Namespaces
- **Modules**: Separate units of code that can be imported and used in other programs.
- **Namespaces**: Containers for variables, functions, and classes to avoid naming conflicts.

### Interoperability
- **Bindings**: Libraries that provide a "wrapper" for an API/Data in another language/platform.

### Package Management
- **Package Managers**: Tools for managing libraries and dependencies.

### Security Features
- **Sanitization**: Features to clean input to prevent injection attacks. Including our own JSON.

### Specialized Paradigms
- **Functional Programming**: First-class functions, immutability, etc.
- **Reactive Programming**: Programming with asynchronous data streams.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism for organizing code around objects and classes.

### Documentation and Comments
- **Docstrings**: Special comments that are used to automatically generate documentation.
- **Annotations**: Metadata added to the code for explaining variables, methods, or logic.
